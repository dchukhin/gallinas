A tutorial for a project using Django and React.

This tutorial will help you set up a Django-based API backend, and focus on allowing you to build a restaurant-searching frontend app using React. It is set up in several parts:
 - `project setup <docs/part_0_project_setup.rst>`_
 - `getting started with React <docs/part_1_getting_started.rst>`_

The main goal of the tutorial is to learn about how to use React by creating your own project, based on a real API. As a part of the project, you are welcome to play around with the API, and to change it to better suit your desires (by learning more about Django and Django REST Framework).

Take a look at the documentation, and get started on the tutorial!
