Project Setup
=============

Prerequisites
-------------

This project uses both a backend and a frontend setup, so you will need several
things installed before going further:

- the backend uses the PostgreSQL database, so you will need to install it.
  You may do so from the `downloads page <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_,
  or from the package manager on your computer (Homebrew, yum, apt, et cetera).
  You do not need to be a database guru to install the database, or to continue
  the tutorial.
- the frontend uses NodeJS, so you will need to install in on your computer.
  You may do so from the NodeJS `downloads page <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_,
  or by using a something like `nvm <https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script>`_
  to manage different versions of NodeJS on your computer.
